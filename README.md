# RetroGamesEmulator

!!!LET US CREATE OUR OWN SEPARATE BRANCHES TO START DEVELOPMENT!!!


Project Structure:
The classes for each game should be in the corresponding packages for each game. Make Subfolders to each Game Package if needed.
The MainMenu Package could be like a main landing page for the emulator where the player can choose a game and a player name before starting a game.
