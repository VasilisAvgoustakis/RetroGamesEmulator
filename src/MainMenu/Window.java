    object's type and the types of data stored in the object.Â´
    After a serialized object has been written into a file, it can be read from the file and
    deserialized that is, the type information and bytes that represent the object and its data can be
    used to recreate the object in memory.
    During serialization, java runtime associates a version number with each serializable class.
    This number called serialVersionUID, which is used during deserialization to verify that the
    sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible
    with respect to serialization.
